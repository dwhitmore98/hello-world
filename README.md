This repository will help me learn the best practices around using GitHub as I learn the basics of CS and programming
I am currently starting my journey in the CS space. In my last semester of undergrad, I am realizing that I want more technical skills in order to better understand the way that products are being designed; this way, in the future, I can understand on a deeper level the products that I will be a part of managing/buying/selling/etc.
